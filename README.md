# Dynamic-Windows-10-Search-bar-killer
Pauses windows 10 related search services when you game. I had microstutters in PUBG (who would have guessed the game lol) and i launched WAP during a gaming session.
I noticed that the search app was causing microstutters during gameplay. This greatly helped minimizing the stutters, but some still occur since its good PUBG.
This app is coded with python. Your AV might flag it, since it is trying to kill windows 10 services. Malwarebytes will let it run.

This is the first iteration of the app and took 1 hour to built. I might add some switch to revert to the default settings easier later on.
